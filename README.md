# Face-Recognition

Face Recognition project is developed using MATLAB where we develop a classifier using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminanr Analysis (LDA). PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. To visualize the results using ROC curve, an additional file is used ezroc.m  to which parameters are fed to get the ROC curve.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB 2017a
Copy the ezroc3.m file to the destitaion where you saved the code to get the ROC curves.
Toolbox: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

### Installing

To install MATLAB click the following link and download the setup along with toolbox needed.

Example:


[Download MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products.html?s_tid=gn_ps)

### Running

To run the project, clone the repository and run the .m files using MATLAB under different project folders.
